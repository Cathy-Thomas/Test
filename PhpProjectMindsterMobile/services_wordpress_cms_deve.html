     <h1>Advantages of Wordpress</h1>
     <h1>1. Wordpress is very good at serializing content by time</h1>
     <p>When you need to post articles or write for the public, WordPress makes   it absurdly simple.</p>
     <h1>2. Wordpress has excellent maintenance and security tools</h1>
       <p>Keeping up with your WP installation on a daily or weekly basis should   not take more than a few minutes at a time.</p>
       <h1>3. Wordpress rocks for providing an easily accessible publishing platform</h1>
       <p>For both content producers and content consumers, the WordPress system   is easy to master, and once mastered, it&rsquo;s very rare to find any &ldquo;big   surprises.&rdquo; WordPress is unlikely to astonish you in unpleasant ways,   that is, the WordPress crew has mastered The Principle Of Least   Astonishment. Some of the problems WP solves are not easy, and they have   done as good a job as any software around.</p>
       <h1>4. WP is very easy to hack (in the good way), so simple customization is   easy</h1>
       <p>In fact, WordPress is a sort of &ldquo;gateway drug&rdquo; for programming. You Have   Been Warned.</p>
       <h1>5. WP is very extensible</h1>
       <p>The plugin and theme APIs are well-documented and work well, so there is   a large and growing ecosystem for themes and plugins.</p>
       <h1>6. Lot’s of built-in tools</h1>
       <p>For the most part, you won’t need to use an FTP much after installing   WordPress. And that’s a big time saver!</p>
       <h1>7. It’s SEO friendly</h1>
       <p>When you put up a site, you want to attract new potential customers from   the search engines. WordPress makes it easy. When you are adding   content to WordPress, it provides the tools you need to make each page   and post more search engine friendly. You can add your keywords and   descriptions automatically as you type. And you can connect up current   posts with past posts, and allow connectivity to take place within your   comments. There are several SEO plugins – choose the one that works the   best for you.</p>
       <h1>8. It’s easy to connect with other social sites</h1>
       <p>Are you on Twitter? Facebook? With a simple plugin, you can connect your   WordPress site up with any other social site. Our Facebook Fan Page   plugin on our site has allowed us to grow followers to well over 10,000   fans. You can also use simple plugins that allow you to put Like buttons   on all your posts, and easily feed your content into a variety of   social networking sites through RSS.</p>
       <h1>9. Easy to update</h1>
       <p>When you use WordPress, you login to your dashboard, which gives you a quick rundown of everything that is happening. Right at the top of the screen, WordPress tells you when a new update is ready – and in just minutes you can have new features, new styles, and major updates that will fix bugs and threats built into your site. [Don't forget to backup before you do any updating!</p>
       <h1>10. It's spam-resistant</h1>
       <p>If you've ever worked with a generic blog, you might be nervous about receiving a ton of spam related messages into your comments section. How are you ever going to control all of that? There is a plugin for that. It automatically puts spam-looking comments into a separate section, making sure you only spend your time on what's truly important to your business. You can always go back and review the spam-related comments when you have the time.</p>
