     <h1>1. Drupal best open source PHP CMS</h1>
     <p>Drupal is the perfect choice for large Enterprise websites with high traffic. Drupal has received extensive accolades for its usefulness and relatively rapid build time. It is also known for its very dynamic nature: websites designed on the Drupal framework can be changed rapidly by modifying modules.</p>

       <h1>3. The difference between Drupal and commercial CMS solutions?</h1>
       <p>Drupal is a highly cost effective CMS solution as it allows us to develop complex websites in much less time it would take using commercial CMS technologies. With literally thousands of community-contributed modules extending the flexibility of Drupal, the chances are that Drupal already supports almost all of the features you could possibly imagine; and in the event that we can't find a module that suits your requirements, we can program new modules quickly and efficiently.</p>
       <h1>4. A big advantage of drupal</h1>
       <p>If your company or organization hires a third party Drupal developer or builds in-house software using the Drupal framework, you are building on an open platform that does not tie you to any one design company, developer or to a proprietary, closed application. You own your site and can develop it with anyone you choose. This is of huge importance if things begin to go wrong with your current design company. Be smart - use Drupal.</p>
       <h1>5. Maintenance ease</h1>
       <p>Once your Drupal website is installed and running, it is simple for even non-technical users to add or edit content, update images, and to manage the critical data that makes your company or organization effective. Anybody with basic word processing skills can easily learn to manage a Drupal site.</p>
       <p>Via a simple, browser-based interface you will be able to easily add new press releases or news items, manage staff pages, job listings, product images, and create an unlimited amount of sections or content pages on your site.</p>
       <h1>Search engine friendly</h1>
       <p>Drupal uses Apache's mod_rewrite to enable customizable URLs that are both user friendly and search engine friendly.</p>
