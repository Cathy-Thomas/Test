     <h1>Ease of use</h1>
     <p>The most popular iPhone apps are very easy to use and can be quite enjoyable. This would make your company's app more desirable to use versus the more traditional methods to acquire your products or services. The more enjoyment the customer receives in using your app, the better your relationship which can translate to higher sales.</p>
     <h1>Attracting new customers</h1>
     <p>As with any business, attracting new customers and making them aware of the benefits of your product is the key to producing more sales. With a well developed iPhone app, companies can advertise their service to a growing tech-savvy audience. This is an innovative way to present your company to the marketplace and will also help with your company's brand recognition.</p>
     <h1>Inc reasing and/or enhancing revenue</h1>
     <p>All businesses are in the business of making money. A quality iPhone apps developer will make suggestions about apps that they will create for you and that relate best to your business and the product you are selling. A well designed app can present companies with new ways to increase profits with additions to their current products or can introduce ways to generate revenue from new offerings.</p>

     <p>Customers can benefit from being able to access your company's service with greater ease. Your company's call center may not be manned twenty four hours a day, but your iPhone app can have a feature where a customer can send a message to your company, day or night. Keeping the lines of communication open is a major benefit to any business relationship. You can also stay in touch with your data base by highlighting upcoming sales or special events by sending customers updates. With the iPhone, developers can make access to your company and its products or services very easy.</p>
