     <h1>Advantages of Joomla</h1>
     <h1>1. Who uses Joomla!... apart from us?</h1>
     <p>Joomla! is used all over the world to power everything from simple,   personal homepages to complex corporate web applications. Here are just   some of the ways this award winning CMS solution is used:   Corporate   websites or portals  Real Estate Websites  Online commerce  Hotel and   Tourism websites  Small business websites  Non-profit and organizational   websites  Government applications  Corporate intranets and extranets    School and church websites  Personal or family homepages    Community-based portals  Magazines and newspapers  the possibilities are   seemingly endless…  It can be used to easily manage every aspect of   your website, from adding content and images to updating a product   catalogue, processing credit card payments or taking online   reservations.</p>
     <h1>2. The difference between Joomla! and commercial CMS solutions?</h1>
       <p>Unlike commercial solutions that offer different versions according to your budget, Joomla! is available in just one 'all encompassing' version - and it is cost free. Many commercial CMS solutions boast a vast array of modules - in some cases up to 80 of them. Joomla! offers an awesome amount of extensions that currently numbers at more than 7300. Wow! Joomla! has an active community of more than 200,000 (validated) friendly users and developers.</p>
       <h1>3. A big advantage you should not overlook...</h1>
       <p>If your company or organization hires a third party Joomla! developer or builds in-house software using the Joomla! framework, you are building on an open platform that does not tie you to any one design company, developer or to a proprietary, closed application. You own your site and can develop it with anyone you choose. This is of huge importance if things begin to go wrong with your current design company. Be smart - use Joomla!</p>
       <h1>4. Is a CMS website search engine friendly?</h1>
       <p>CMS offers the best platform to develop sites that meet all the SEO requirements.HTML layout is well formed with no nestled tables making it easy to read for crawlers.We can ensure that URL's do not have any query strings. The URL's can be of the type www.yoursite.com/pagename.html Such URL's are extremely Search engine friendly.Meta keywords can be defined at a global level (across the site) and also at page level.</p>
       <p>Via a simple, browser-based interface you will be able to easily add new press releases or news items, manage staff pages, job listings, product images, and create an unlimited amount of sections or content pages on your site.</p>
       <h1>5. Is a CMS web site difficult to maintain?</h1>
       <p>Once Joomla! is installed and running, it is simple for even non-technical users to add or edit content, update images, and to manage the critical data that makes your company or organization effective. Anybody with basic word processing skills can easily learn to manage a Joomla! site. Via a simple, browser-based interface you will be able to easily add new press releases or news items, manage staff pages, job listings, product images, and create an unlimited amount of sections or content pages on your site.</p>
       <h1>6. Is a Joomla! CMS website expensive?</h1>
       <p>The emergence of powerful, flexible, Open Source CMS's is truly a   revolution in web technology. Firms like Interwoven, Broadvision, and of   course Microsoft, have in the past dominated the CMS market with   offerings that start at Euro 12,000 (plus plus PLUS)! Whilst it may seem   too good to be true, highly functional CMS platforms are now available   without licensing costs. It is true!</p>
       <p>Today, Mindster can develop a Joomla based (CMS) web site starting with 2500 USD</p>
       <h1>7. What about multi-lingual web sites?</h1>
       <p>Probably one of the biggest advantages of our CMS solution is its ability to run multi-lingual web sites - and there is only one 'back office' to manage it all! Joomla recognises a users operating system and automatically displays a site in the users language if it is available. Of course users may switch to other languages as they wish.</p>
       <p>Mindster designed and developed several <strong>multilingual cms websites</strong>.   The sites also rank very well indeed in the Google search engines of   all the languages used.</p>
       <h1>8. Decentralised Editing on any browser!</h1>
       <p>Editing can be done with any normal web browser from anywhere in the world - or with your iPhone :)</p>
